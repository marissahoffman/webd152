    <p>Trying different coffee shops and their unique creations is one of my favorite things to do. In the summertime,
        I love an iced latte, particularly one with a fun flavor and cute name. Some of my favorites are banana, 
        coconut, pistachio and brown sugar. I also prefer my lattes to be make with coconut milk. Yum!
